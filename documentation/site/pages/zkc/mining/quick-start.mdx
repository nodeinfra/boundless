# Quick Start

## What is ZK Mining?

Proof of Verifiable Work (PoVW), a novel invention within Boundless, is a permissionless incentive mechanism which enables provers to be rewarded in *$ZKC* in exchange for their proving work on the Boundless marketplace or elsewhere. Provers generating zero-knowledge proofs are rewarded with *$ZKC*; this process is known as *ZK Mining*. 

## Who can ZK mine?

* Provers must satisfy the [minimum hardware requirements](/provers/quick-start#requirements) to be able to run [Bento](/provers/proving-stack#what-is-bento).
* Provers must [stake $ZKC](/zkc/quick-start#how-to-stake-zkc) to be eligible for PoVW rewards. 
  * Before staking, any proving work submitted *is not* eligible for rewards.
  * After staking, any work submitted is eligible for rewards in the current reward epoch.
* The maximum mining rewards each prover can earn for each reward epoch is directly correlated with their total staked *$ZKC*. It is approximately `staked_amount/15` (please see the [token documentation](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/zkc?tab=readme-ov-file#zkc) for more information).
* Provers must enable ZK mining in Bento by specifying the `REWARD_ADDRESS` environment variable. 
* To learn how to enable ZK mining, see [How to enable ZK mining?](/zkc/mining/quick-start#how-to-enable-zk-mining).

## ZK Mining Lifecycle

::::steps
#### Provers generate ZK proofs + work proofs

Generating a ZK proof, with the "Reward Address" specified in Bento, will generate an associated "work proof". This work proof proves that the prover generated a valid ZK proof and tallies the amount of "work" done (measured in [cycles](https://dev.risczero.com/terminology#clock-cycles)). 

#### Provers aggregate work proofs with `prepare`

The `prepare` CLI command (`boundless povw prepare ...`) compresses all local work proofs (stored in Bento) to reflect work done during any given epoch. This aggregated proof is stored in a local “state” file.

#### Provers submit work log update with `submit`

Towards the end of an epoch, the prover must verify their work done to the PoVW contracts using the `submit` CLI command (`boundless povw submit ...`).

Provers submit the aggregated work proof to the PoVW smart contract to prove their total work done during the current reward epoch. `submit` uses the rewards address's private key for signing and posting the work proof onchain.

#### Provers wait for current epoch to finalize

The prover waits for the current reward epoch to finalize. This allows all work log updates to be tallied, and all the respective rewards for each rewards address to be calculated.

To check details of the current epoch, please see [Checking Details of Current Reward Epoch](/zkc/mining/claiming-rewards#checking-details-of-current-reward-epoch),

#### Provers claim rewards with `claim`

Once the epoch has been finalized, the `claim` CLI command can be used to claim any unclaimed rewards; `claim` uses Steel to query all work log updates and verify reward calculations. Claiming rewards does not have to be done every epoch; all unclaimed rewards from past epochs will be claimed automatically on the next valid `claim` call.

#### Repeat steps 1 - 4 every epoch

With the start of the new epoch, all provers start with a work total of 0. Provers continue to generate ZK proofs, and submit an aggregated work proof *at least once* every epoch to be eligible for rewards (based on the total work done by all provers).

Provers will require NVIDIA GPUs and Ubuntu 24.04. For a full list of requirements, please see [Requirements](/provers/quick-start#requirements).

::::steps

### Stop Bento Safely

To enable PoVW in Bento, first make sure to stop Bento safely. This ensures that any in-progress proving jobs are completed before terminating the proving process. If Bento is backing the Broker, please carry out *Step 1* from [Safe Upgrade Steps](/provers/broker#safe-upgrade-steps) and then return to this page.

Bento and/or broker can be safely stopped with:

```bash
just broker down
```

### Install the latest release

To install the latest release, and use the helpful setup script, provers can follow the instructions on the [Quick Start](/provers/quick-start) before continuing with the next step.

### Install the latest version of Rust

Follow the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Make sure to have the Boundless CLI installed

Provers use the Boundless CLI to stake $ZKC, prepare work log updates, and submit them onchain. To install the Boundless CLI (and build with CUDA support), run:

```bash
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless boundless-cli --branch release-1.0 --bin boundless
```

### Install the latest version of Foundry

Some commands in this tutorial use [cast](https://getfoundry.sh/cast/overview) from the [Foundry toolkit](https://getfoundry.sh/). This is not necessary, but it will make some CLI commands more straightforward.

### Install the latest version of rzup

Follow the instructions [here](https://dev.risczero.com/api/zkvm/install#installation-for-x86-64-linux-and-arm64-macos).

### Install `risc0-groth16` using `rzup`

Run the following:

```bash
rzup install risc0-groth16
```

### Specify the Reward Address

:::tip[Tip]
Provers can use their $ZKC staking address as their Reward Address but this is not recommended. In practice, provers should use a separate wallet to stake $ZKC. For more information, see [Wallet Setup](/zkc/mining/wallet-setup).
:::

Before starting Bento again, provers need to enable the PoVW feature. This requires a valid Ethereum address set to the `REWARD_ADDRESS` environment variable. It is recommended to set this directly in the compose.yml file:

```yml
x-base-environment: &base-environment
    DATABASE_URL: postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER:-worker}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-password}@${POSTGRES_HOST:-postgres}:${POSTGRES_PORT:-5432}/${POSTGRES_DB:-taskdb}
  REDIS_URL: redis://${REDIS_HOST:-redis}:6379
  S3_URL: http://${MINIO_HOST:-minio}:9000
  S3_BUCKET: ${MINIO_BUCKET:-workflow}
  S3_ACCESS_KEY: ${MINIO_ROOT_USER:-admin}
  S3_SECRET_KEY: ${MINIO_ROOT_PASS:-password}
  RUST_LOG: ${RUST_LOG:-info}
  RISC0_HOME: /usr/local/risc0
  RUST_BACKTRACE: 1
  REWARD_ADDRESS: "0x1234...5678" // [!code hl] [!code focus]
```

### Start Bento

Once enabled, Bento can be run as normal with:

```bash
just bento
```

Or if running the broker as well:

```bash
just broker
```

will start both the broker and Bento.

### Generate Proofs + Submit Work Proofs Onchain

Once Bento is running, provers can run proving jobs as normal. Bento will now create a work proof for every proving job; a work proof cryptographically proves how much work Bento has done (in [cycles](https://dev.risczero.com/terminology#clock-cycles)). 

Using the Boundless CLI, provers aggregate these work proofs and submit the aggregated work proof *at least once* per [reward epoch](/zkc/quick-start#how-do-zkc-rewards-work) to be eligible for that epoch's mining rewards. This process is documented in [Mining + Claiming Rewards](/zkc/mining/claiming-rewards).
