# Quick Start
## Video Walkthrough

:::note[Boundless has launched Mainnet]
This video was recorded early July 2025 during Boundless Mainnet Beta; there have been some further changes to the setup process. For the latest commands, make sure to check the tutorial below.
:::

To run your prover on Base Mainnet, follow the steps in the video below and make sure to set your RPC endpoint to Base mainnet i.e:

```bash [Terminal]
export RPC_URL="https://base-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/{YOUR_ALCHEMY_APP_ID}"`
```

## Requirements

A recommended minimum configuration for proving performance:

* CPU - 16 threads, reasonable single core boost performance (>3Ghz)
* RAM - 32 GB
* Disk - 200 GB of solid state storage, NVME / SSD preferred
* GPUs: at least one NVIDIA GPU with >= 8GB of VRAM.
    - In testing, we've found the best performance on the following NVIDIA GPUs: 4090, and L4.
    - While it's possible to use a single GPU, we recommend at least 10 GPUs to run a competitive prover.
* OS: Ubuntu 24.04

## Clone the Boundless Repo

:::tip[Use Ubuntu]
We recommend using Ubuntu 24.04 for your proving node.
:::

To get started, first clone the Boundless monorepo on your proving machine, and switch to the [latest release](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless/releases):

```bash [Terminal]
git clone https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless
cd boundless
git checkout release-1.0
```

## Install Dependencies

:::tip[Tip]
This stage can be skipped if you already have docker and docker-nvidia installed.
:::

To run a Boundless prover, you'll need the following dependencies:

* [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose)
* [Docker Nvidia Support](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/index.html) (*Note: the install process requires enabling NVIDIAâ€™s experimental packages*)

For a quick set up of Boundless dependencies on Ubuntu 24.04, please run:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/setup.sh
```

### Setup Environment Variables

You'll need to set two environment variables:

```bash [Terminal]
export PRIVATE_KEY=""
export RPC_URL=""
```

This is the private key to the wallet which will represent your prover on the market; make sure it has funds. For the RPC url, we recommend using an [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com) endpoint for the network you want to prove on.

## Running a Test Proof

:::tip[See all just commands]
We make use of [just](https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#just) to make running complex commands easier. To see available `just` commands for Boundless, run `just` within the root `boundless/` folder.
:::

Boundless is comprised of two major components:
1. *Bento* is the local proving infrastructure. Bento will take requests, prove them and return the result.
2. The *Broker* interacts with the Boundless market. Broker can submit or request proves from the market.

To get started with a test proof on a new proving machine, you'll need to install the `bento_cli`:

```bash [Terminal]
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless bento-client --branch release-1.0 --bin bento_cli
```
Once installed, you can run bento with:

```bash [Terminal]
just bento
```

This will spin up bento without the broker. You can check the logs at any time with:

```bash [Terminal]
just bento logs
```

To run the test proof:

```bash [Terminal]
RUST_LOG=info bento_cli -c 32
```

If everything works, you should see something like the following:

![Bento CLI Test Proof Success](/test-proof.png)

## Running the Broker

:::tip[Need technical support?]
For technical support, please join the [Boundless Discord](https://discord.com/invite/boundlessxyz) and claim the prover role from [Guild.xyz](https://guild.xyz/boundless-xyz).
:::

We have checked that bento successfully generated a test proof. We are now ready to run the broker so that we can start proving on Boundless.

### Install the Boundless CLI

Before we start, we'll need to install the *Boundless CLI* (which is separate to the Bento CLI we installed earlier):

```bash [Terminal]
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless boundless-cli --branch release-1.0 --bin boundless
```

### Deposit Collateral

:::warning
*$ZKC* is only on Ethereum mainnet. 

Therefore, to use *$ZKC* as proving collateral, provers have to first [bridge *$ZKC*](/zkc/proving-collateral) from Ethereum mainnet to Base mainnet. 
:::

With the environment variables set, you can now deposit *$ZKC* tokens as collateral to your account balance:

```bash [Terminal]
boundless account deposit-collateral 10
```

### Start Broker

You can now start broker (which runs both bento + broker i.e. the full proving stack!):

```bash [Terminal]
just broker
```

To check the proving logs, you can use:

```bash [Terminal]
just broker logs
```
### Stop Broker

To stop broker, you can run:

```bash [Terminal]
just broker down
```

Or remove all volumes and data from the service:

```bash [Terminal]
just broker clean
```

## Configuring Broker

### Custom Environment

Instead of passing environment variables for each shell session as we did above, you can set them in `.env.broker`. There is an [.env.broker-template](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless/blob/main/.env.broker-template) available for you to get started:

```bash [Terminal]
cp .env.broker-template .env.broker
```

After which, you can use a text editor to adjust the environment variables as required.

To run broker with a custom environment file:

```bash [Terminal]
just broker up ./.env.broker
just broker down ./.env.broker
```

### Broker.toml

Broker can be configured using the [Broker.toml](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless/blob/main/broker.toml) configuration file.

For example, to adjust the maximum number of proofs that can be processed at once, you can set:

```toml [boundless/Broker.toml]
# Maximum number of concurrent proofs that can be processed at once
max_concurrent_proofs = 2 # change "2"
```

To see all Broker.toml configuration settings, please see [Broker Configuration & Operation/Settings in Broker.toml](/provers/broker#settings-in-brokertoml).

### Multi Host

Services can be run on other hosts, as long as the IP addresses for things link PostgreSQL / Redis / MinIO are updated on the remote host.

See the `.env.broker-template` HOST configuration options [here](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless/blob/main/.env.broker-template) to adjust them.

## Configuring Bento

The `compose.yml` file defines all services within Bento. The Boundless repo includes a starter `compose.yml` which you can see [here](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless/blob/main/compose.yml).

### Multi GPU

Under the `exec_agent` service in `compose.yml`, the default configuration utilises a single GPU:

```yml [compose.yml]
deploy:
  resources:
    reservations:
      devices:
        - driver: nvidia
          device_ids: ['0']
          capabilities: [gpu]
```

To add a second GPU, first check your GPUs are recognised with:

```bash [Terminal]
nvidia-smi -L
```
which should output something like:

```bash
GPU 0: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 (UUID: GPU-abcde123-4567-8901-2345-abcdef678901)
GPU 1: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 (UUID: GPU-fedcb987-6543-2109-8765-abcdef123456)
```

We can see that GPU 1 is listed with the device ID of `1`. To add this GPU, uncomment `gpu_prove_agent1` from `compose.yml`:

```yml [compose.yml]
gpu_prove_agent1: # [!code hl]
  <<: *agent-common
  runtime: nvidia
  deploy:
    resources:
      reservations:
        devices:
          - driver: nvidia
            device_ids: ['1'] # [!code hl]
            capabilities: [gpu]
```

For 3 or more GPUs, add the corresponding `gpu_prove_agentX` where `X` matches the device ID of each GPU, making sure that the `device_ids` field is populated with a matching `X`: `['X']`.

### Segment Size

:::note[Segment Sizes + Security]
Larger `SEGMENT_SIZE` values also impact the proving systems conjectured security bits slightly (see [RISC Zero - Cryptographic Security Model](https://dev.risczero.com/api/security-model#how-secure-are-the-stark-provers)).
:::

`SEGMENT_SIZE` is specified in powers-of-two (po2). Larger segment sizes are preferable for performance, but require more GPU VRAM. To pick the right `SEGMENT_SIZE` for your GPU VRAM, see [the performance optimization page](/provers/performance-optimization#finding-the-maximum-segment_size-for-gpu-vram).

#### Setting SEGMENT_SIZE

The recommended way to change the segment size is to set the environment variable `SEGMENT_SIZE`, before running broker, to your specified value. This can be done through the [.env.broker](/provers/quick-start#custom-environment) file.

You can also configure the `SEGMENT_SIZE` in `compose.yml` under the `exec_agent` service; it defaults to 21:

```yml [compose.yml]
exec_agent:
  <<: *agent-common
  runtime: nvidia

  mem_limit: 4G
  cpus: 4

  environment:
    <<: *base-environment
    RISC0_KECCAK_PO2: ${RISC0_KECCAK_PO2:-17}
    entrypoint: /app/agent -t exec --segment-po2 ${SEGMENT_SIZE:-21} # [!code hl]
```
